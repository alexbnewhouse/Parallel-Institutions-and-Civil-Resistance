What is the impact of parallel institution-building on non-state actorsâ€™ strategic campaigns? Non-state campaigns, both violent and nonviolent, occasionally attempt to develop independent institutions for the provision of public goods and services and for the execution of political tasks. In this paper, I employ the Nonviolent and Violent Campaign Outcomes 2.1 (NAVCO) dataset to measure how building parallel institutions affects the longevity and success rates of campaigns. Using survival analysis, I show that education and social welfare institutions can help campaigns achieve their goals, but that this effect diverges based on the violence of a campaign.

### Hypotheses

* **Hypothesis 1**: Social welfare and educational institutions help political resistance campaigns achieve their goals.
* **Hypothesis 2**: Campaigns with traditional or new media systems last longer and have higher rates of success than those without.
* **Hypothesis 3**: Violent campaigns are benefitted by building education systems, while nonviolent campaigns are benefitted by social welfare systems.

### Dependent and Independent Variables
**DV**: Campaign length; campaign success or failure.

**IV**: Parallel institutions:

* Law Enforcement
* Education
* Social Welfare
* Traditional Media
* New Media
* Courts

Condition: 

* Violence or nonviolence of campaign

### Methods

* Random Effects Linear Regression: Campaign Length vs. Parallel Institutions
* Binomial Logistic Regression: Campaign Success vs. Parallel Institutions
* Multinomial Logistic Regression: Campaign Success OR Failure vs. Parallel Institutions
* Competing Risks Survival Analysis: Campaign Success Hazard Rates on Parallel Institutions, with Failure as Competing Event

### Results

#### Campaign Length

* No independent variable of interest has a clear impact on campaign length; educational institutions _may_ have a slight conditional effect with the violence of the campaign.
* Media coverage shortens campaigns.

#### Campaign Success 

* Across all model specifications, education and social welfare have the strongest effects on success rates. 
* Both competing risks and multinomial logit show that violent campaigns are harmed by building social welfare systems and helped by building educational systems.
  * These results are significant at least at the .1 level in the competing risks regression. 
* I replicate previous findings that nonviolent tactics, security force defections, campaign size, and campaign support from the regime have significant positive effects on success rates. International support of the regime and repression of the campaign have significant negative impacts.
